## Overview

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator App is a mobile application built using the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework. This app allows users to calculate their BMI, a simple and widely used measure for assessing whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.

The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their weight and height, and then receive their BMI score along with an interpretation of what the score means in terms of their body weight.

## Features

- Calculate BMI: Input your weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters) to calculate your BMI.
- Interpretation: The app provides an interpretation of the BMI score, indicating whether it falls within the underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese range.
- Metric Units: The app uses the metric system for weight and height inputs.
- User-Friendly: The user interface is simple and easy to use, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
